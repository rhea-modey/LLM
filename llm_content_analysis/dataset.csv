Reconstruction will begin six months after that. So, 2020 has not been the year I hoped it would be. My ordeal combined with the COVID-19 pandemic has been surreal. But through it all, I have had great support from my family and friends.”- Darlene Langley, breast cancer survivor."

It took a lot of work to feel at peace with my decision. My breasts had fed both of my children and served me well, but now it was time to let them go. I feel proud to still be here and to have highlighted that beauty comes in different shapes and sizes. It is what is inside us that shines out. Today, I am enough. Boobless and all."

'You can imagine my confusion when the lump I found turned out to be trying to kill me. 'I was examined for all of two seconds. still remember the exact words: "You are very young. At 24, you are hormonal at this age, the scan isn’t needed. It’s normal." 'Normal. For 18 months I went around thinking that my lump was just "normal". 'Fast forward to July 2020. I was in the shower and I noticed a puckering of my skin. I knew this wasn’t "normal". 
Breast Cancer Now,6, https://www.facebook.com/breastcancernow/posts/10158576355725306, "As soon as my hair grew back and I looked like myself again, people assumed I’d moved on from breast cancer. They certainly had, and they didn’t want to hear me mention it again. 'It seemed to them that I was ‘fine now’, I ‘look good’, and I ‘should not look to the past’. I’ve had comments that 'continuing to go on about cancer in your blogs is not healthy’, and I ‘really should move on’ 'I go for check-ups every couple of months and I get scan anxiety. Until they tell me everything is clear I’m practically holding my breath fearing the worst. When I get the all clear I feel lightheaded and elated, but a couple of days later the thoughts come back again. 'I manage the fear, but I don’t forget about cancer. It’s not like having a broken leg – a little rehabilitation and then forget it happened. 'When you are diagnosed with cancer it’s the worst thing that can happen. You change forever and I find it hurtful that people would expect such a traumatic experience to become something distant in your mind. 'Everyone who has been diagnosed with cancer – no matter how long ago – remembers that moment like a punch in the stomach. It’s not something we can forget. 'I would like the ability to express my fear and to also talk about my experiences without the eye rolls and the looking away pretending not to hear what I’m saying.'"
